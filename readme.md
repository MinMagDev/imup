# Installing

For windows, can't test for other systems. 

## Step 1

Clone the repository in a folder and add that folder to PATH.

## Step 2

- Add all the **important** inforation to template.env. Those are: `base_url, email, password`.
- Remove the template from the file Name (it should now be just .env)

# Usage
Now you can use this tool anywhere with the following Syntax:

```Batch
imup <file-name> <file-path> <task-number>
```

- `<file-name>` can be chosen how you like, but don't forget the .zip at the end.
- `<file-path>`is the path to the file you want to upload
- `<task-number>` is the consecutive Numbering of the tasks (4.1 is equal to 20)

Then just wait for the results to come in
